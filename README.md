# Data-Science-Class
Assignments and projects from my Introduction to Data Science class

These assignments all use the Jupyter Notebook. 

**To Run**

After cloning the repo and going into the Data-Science_Class directory:

&nbsp;run <code> jupyter notebook </code> in the command line in the Data-Science-Class directory. 

The notebook should start up in a browser and you can view each file in the browser window.
